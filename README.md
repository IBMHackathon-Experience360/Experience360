Alpha Motors is a global motorbikes company. The sales and marketing happens via multiple online and offline channels like web/online, direct shop, service center, third party sales. Similarly, the leads/opportunities are also collected via multiple online/offline,social,  channels.

This often leads to duplication of Customer Data and hence Alpha Motors is NOT able to give a unified customer experience.

Unified Customer Experience is required so that we have ‘connected’ sales based on earlier purchases, provide ‘targeted’ promotions etc.
